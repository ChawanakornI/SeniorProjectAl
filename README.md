# ALLCARE · Active Learning for Clinical Labeling

![Project Status Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_development-yellow?style=flat-square)

## Overview
- Our senior project focused on reducing manual labeling workload for medical professionals.
  ALLCARE applies active learning to surface the most informative unlabeled cases for review.
  The goal is to accelerate accurate decision making while keeping the clinician in full control.

## Highlights
- **Human-in-the-loop design:** clinicians validate and correct suggestions generated by the model.
- **Smarter annotation queue:** active learning ranks data points so experts spend time where it matters most.
- **Productivity insights:** track labeling progress and model improvements as the dataset grows.

## Documentation & Planning
- `Requirements.md` — functional and technical expectations.
- `Usecase.md` — key user journeys and interaction notes.
- Roadmap and additional docs will be published as milestones and requirements are confirmed and finalized
